Database: SQL_Project_RetailSalesAnalysis
(PostgreSQL)

This project allowed me to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.
